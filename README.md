This React native real-time chat was created with the purpose of learning and enhancing my react-native knowledge.

I used React-native along with Socket.IO for a real-time experience, along with a Koa API and postgreSQL for the backend stack (with socket.io-server).

Feel free to clone this repository and use it however you want to, it's a good way to learn react-native.
